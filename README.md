# CrewAI Practice  

This repository is my practice space for working with **CrewAI**, an open-source framework designed for orchestrating role-playing AI agents that collaborate on complex tasks. CrewAI enables multiple AI agents to work together efficiently, making it useful for automating workflows and problem-solving.  

## What I Practiced in This Repo  

In this repository, I explored how to set up and manage AI agents using CrewAI. My practice involved:  

- **Defining AI agents** in `agents.py`, assigning them roles and objectives.  
- **Setting up the crew** in `crew.py`, organizing how these agents interact and collaborate.  
- **Creating tasks** in `tasks.py`, defining what each agent needs to accomplish.  
- **Using tools** in `tools.py`, providing additional functionality to enhance agent capabilities.  

By working through these files, I got hands-on experience with CrewAIâ€™s workflow, learning how to build autonomous agent teams that can execute tasks efficiently.
